# RawPawApp
My first Android mobile application with the first update.

It's designed to help dog and cat owner keep their pet on a ideal weight (especially those pets which are fed raw).

-----
This was a private project for myself, and creating this app I learned many things. Some of the skills I learned:
- I got very familiar with the official Android IDE - Android Studio
- I learned about JSON/GSON, how to serialize an object and how to deserialize an object
- How to switch from activity to activity
- I got familiar with DB Browser for SQLite
- I got to know better the programming logic
- I learned how to upload a project on Google Store (my app is available for free on Google Store since 11/2018.) and I learned how
  to upload an update (I updated my app on january 2019.)

In this list above are some major things that I have learned programming my first mobile app for Android.
